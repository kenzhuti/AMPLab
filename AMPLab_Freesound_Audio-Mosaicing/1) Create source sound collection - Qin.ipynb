    "# 1) Create source sound collection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes the code to create the collection of sounds that will later be used as source material for our audio mosaicing application. The collection of sounds is created by defining a number of queries to be performed using the Freesound API and concatenanting the results of each query. A number of metadata fields are stored for each sound in the collection and saved into a Pandas DataFrame object and CSV file in disk. For each sound in the collection, we also download an OGG preview and store it in disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the `freesound` Python package for interacting with the Freesound API. The source code for this package can be found here: https://github.com/mtg/freesound-python. In this repository you'll find a Python script with [examples](https://github.com/MTG/freesound-python/blob/master/examples.py) to learn how to interact with the API. Nevertheless, if you are further interested in the Freesound API, check the [API documentation](http://freesound.org/docs/api/) which provides more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: A Freesound API key is provided in this notebook, but you should make a Freesound account and get your own key. You can get a key here: https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/"
